## What is classification?

- Supervised classification includes multivariate techniques finding a rule for separating observations/cases into known classes, and using this rule to classify new observations.
- The process starts with a training sample, that is the full data set with known classes. Typically the variables that will be used to generate the classification rule are easy/cheap to measure, but the class is more difficult to measure. It is important to be able to classify new observations using variables that are easy to measure.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised

Unsupervised classification, also called cluster analysis, differs from supervised in that the classes are not known ahead of time, and need to be discovered first and labelled.
