## Using the packages tidyr, dplyr

During a ten week sensory experiment, 12 individuals were asked to assess taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do the fries taste?)

French fries were fried in one of three different oils, and each week individuals had to assess six batches of french fries (all three oils, replicated twice)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(xtable)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)

head(french_fries)
```

## This format is not ideal for data analysis

What code would be needed to plot each of the ratings over time as a different color?

```
library(ggplot2)
french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10,]
qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, 
   fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), 
  fill = I("orange")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), 
  fill = I("yellow")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), 
  fill = I("green")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), 
   fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

## The Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10,]

qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, fill = I("red"), 
      geom = "boxplot") +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), fill = I("orange")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("yellow")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

## What we have ..

We want to change this **wide format**:

## and what we want

to this **long format**:
