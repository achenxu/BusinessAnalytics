## Using the packages tidyr, dplyr

During a ten week sensory experiment, 12 individuals were asked to assess taste of french fries (HOT CHIPS!) on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do the fries taste?)

French fries were fried in one of three different oils, and each week individuals had to assess six batches of french fries (all three oils, replicated twice)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(xtable)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)

head(french_fries)
```

## This format is not ideal for data analysis

What code would be needed to plot each of the ratings over time as a different color?

```
library(ggplot2)
french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10,]
qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, 
   fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), 
  fill = I("orange")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), 
  fill = I("yellow")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), 
  fill = I("green")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), 
   fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

## The Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

french_sub <- french_fries[french_fries$time == 10,]

qplot("1_potato", potato, data = french_sub, fill = I("red"), 
      geom = "boxplot") +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_buttery", y = buttery), fill = I("orange")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("yellow")) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_painty", y = painty), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

## What we have ..

We want to change this **wide format**:

![wide](../figures/tableoverview.png)

## and what we want

to this **long format**:

![long](../figures/tablelong.png)

## Gathering

+ When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

+ Keys/Identifiers:
-- Identify a record (must be unique)
-- Example: Indices on an random variable
-- Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
-- May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

+ Values/Measures:
-- Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
-- Usually numeric quantities

## Gathering the French Fry Data

```
french_fries_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty)

head(french_fries_long)
```

```{r, echo=F}
french_fries_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty)

head(french_fries_long)
```

## Let's Re-write the code for our Plot

```
french_fries_long_sub <- french_fries_long[
  french_fries_long$time == 10,]

qplot(variable, rating, data = french_fries_long_sub, 
  fill = variable, geom = "boxplot")
```

## And plot it

```{r, echo=FALSE}
french_fries_long_sub <- french_fries_long[
  french_fries_long$time == 10,]

qplot(variable, rating, data = french_fries_long_sub, 
      fill = variable, geom = "boxplot")
```

## Long to Wide

In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (Perhaps displaying in a table).

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(french_fries_long)
```

## Spread

We use the **spread** function from tidyr to do this:

```
french_fries_wide <- spread(french_fries_long, 
  key = variable, value = rating)
head(french_fries_wide)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
french_fries_wide <- spread(french_fries_long, key = variable, value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

## The Split-Apply-Combine Approach

- *Split* a dataset into many smaller sub-datasets
- *Apply* some function to each sub-dataset to compute a result
- *Combine* the results of the function calls into a one dataset

## The Split-Apply-Combine Approach

![SAC](../figures/sac.png)

## Split-Apply-Combine in dplyr

```
library(dplyr)
french_fries_split <- group_by(french_fries_long, 
  variable) # SPLIT
french_fries_apply <- summarise(french_fries_split, 
  m = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE), s=sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) 
  # APPLY + COMBINE
french_fries_apply
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
french_fries_split <- group_by(french_fries_long, variable) # SPLIT
french_fries_apply <- summarise(french_fries_split, m = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE), s=sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) # APPLY + COMBINE
french_fries_apply
```

## The pipe operator

- dplyr allows us to chain together these data analysis tasks using the `%>%` (pipe) operator
- `x %>% f(y)` is shorthand for `f(x, y)`
- Example:

```
french_fries %>%
    gather(key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty) %>%
    group_by(variable) %>%
    summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## dplyr verbs

There are five primary dplyr **verbs**, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- Filter: Remove the rows of a data frame, producing subsets
- Arrange: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- Select: Select particular columns of a data frame
- Mutate: Add new columns that are functions of existing columns
- Summarise: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame
 
## Filter

```
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
french_fries %>%
    gather(key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty) %>%
    group_by(variable) %>%
    summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Arrange

```
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

## Select

```
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

## Summarise

```
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

## Dates and Times

Dates are deceptively hard to work with in R.

**Example**: 02/05/2012. Is it February 5th, or May 2nd?

Other things are difficult too:

- Time zones
- POSIXct format in base R is challenging

The **lubridate** package helps tackle some of these issues.

## Basic Lubridate Use

```
library(lubridate)

now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
library(lubridate)

now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

## Parsing Dates

```
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:50:30", tz = "America/Chicago")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:50:30", tz = "America/Chicago")
```
