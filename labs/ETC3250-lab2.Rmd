## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Spend a few minutes looking over that website before continuing with this document.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
summary(Wage)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(wage, data=Wage, binwidth=10)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Equations can be included using LaTeX commands like this:
$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2.$$
Or inline mathematical symbols such as $\alpha$ and $\infty$. You can learn more about simple LaTeX commands at [StackExchange](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference)

Try knitting this file as html, and then knit as Word


## Create a Project

- Project directories keep your work organized. 
- Create a project for this course, call it ETC3250. (You can use another name, if you prefer.) This will keep your data, your code, your results all located in one place. 
- Each time you start RStudio for this class, be sure to open this project.
- Note that the name of the current project can be seen at the top right of the RStudio window.


## Documenting R Code

The following R code is included as a single block. Break it into sections and use R Markdown to document what the analysis tells you about the `Wages` data set.

```{r}
qplot(age, wage, data=Wage) + geom_smooth()

table(Wage$education, Wage$maritl)
table(Wage$education, Wage$race)
table(Wage$maritl, Wage$race)

qplot(maritl, age, data=Wage, geom='boxplot') + coord_flip()
qplot(education, wage, data=Wage, geom="boxplot") + coord_flip()

Wage$Year <- as.factor(Wage$year)
qplot(Year, wage, data=Wage, geom="boxplot", fill=Year) + guides(fill=FALSE)

qplot(race, wage, data=Wage, geom="boxplot") + coord_flip()

qplot(Year, wage, data=Wage, geom="boxplot", fill=jobclass) + coord_flip()

fit <- lm(log(wage) ~ year + age + education + race + jobclass + health + maritl, data=Wage)
summary(fit)
```

Can you interpret the coefficients?


## Exploring the bias-variance tradeoff

The following code fits a spline curve to the relationship between wage and age. Experiment with different values of `df` (degrees of freedom) and select one that you think is about right.

```{r}
library(splines)
p <- qplot(age, wage, data=Wage)

fit <- lm(log(wage) ~ ns(age, df=2), data=Wage)
Wage$fc <- exp(fitted(fit))

p + geom_line(aes(age, fc), data=Wage, col='blue')
```

Now we will test which value of `df` minimizes the MSE on some test data.

First, we randomly split the `Wage` data set into training and test sets, with 2000 observations in the training data and 1000 observations in the test data.

```{r}
idx <- sample(1:nrow(Wage), size=2000)
train <- Wage[idx,]
test <- Wage[-idx,]
```

Next try different values of `df`:

```{r}
# MSE on training and test sets
trainingMSE <- testMSE <- numeric(20)
for(i in 1:20)
{
  fit <- lm(log(wage) ~ ns(age, df=i), data=train)
  trainingMSE[i] <- mean((train$wage - exp(fitted(fit)))^2)
  testMSE[i] <- mean((test$wage - exp(predict(fit,newdata=test)))^2)
}

qplot(degree, trainingMSE, geom="line",
     data=data.frame(degree=1:20, trainingMSE, testMSE)) +
  geom_line(aes(degree, testMSE), col='blue')

which.min(testMSE)
```

 - Which value of `df` gives the minimum training MSE?
 - Which value of `df` gives the minimum test MSE?
 - How close is this to your "guessed" value of `df`?
 - Do you get the same results if you repeat the exercise on different splits of training and test data?
 
# A model for wages
 
Repeat this analysis, but use the full linear model including the other variables in the data set. That is, fit models like this (but choose the optimal `df`):

```{r}
fit <- lm(log(wage) ~ year + ns(age, df=5) + education + race + jobclass + health + maritl, data=Wage)
```

How much better is the test MSE once you include the other predictor variables?

Finally, we will check the residuals, assuming your best model is stored as `fit`.

```{r}
library(gridExtra)
res <- residuals(fit)
resplots <- list()
resplots[[1]] <- qplot(res)
resplots[[2]] <- qplot(age,res, data=Wage)
resplots[[3]] <- qplot(factor(year),res, data=Wage, geom="boxplot")
resplots[[4]] <- qplot(education,res, data=Wage, geom="boxplot")
resplots[[5]] <- qplot(race,res, data=Wage, geom="boxplot")
resplots[[6]] <- qplot(jobclass,res, data=Wage, geom="boxplot")
resplots[[7]] <- qplot(health,res, data=Wage, geom="boxplot")
resplots[[8]] <- qplot(maritl,res, data=Wage, geom="boxplot")

marrangeGrob(resplots, ncol=2, nrow=4, top="Residual plots")
```

Do you see anything unusual in the residual plots?


```{r}
res <- residuals(fit)
outliers <- subset(Wage, abs(res) > 1.5)
```

What makes the outlier unusual?

## Assignment 2

Submit an R markdown document that only includes:

  1. fitting your final model above;
  2. summary statistics for the residuals;
  3. a plot of the residuals against the fitted values. 

It should knit without errors and without assuming any packages have been pre-loaded.

## Exercises from ISLR

Work your way through the exercises at the end of chapter 2 of ISLR.
